    <p>
        It is very famous that coffee originated in Ethiopia.
        Ethiopia's main coffee harvesting area is wild coffee groves. Coffee in Ethiopia, which is generally produced by a wet process, is produced in the three regions of Sidamo, Hara and Kapace. When talking about the characteristics of the Ethiopian Cup, it is sometimes surprisingly bold. Incredibly rich in both flavor and body.    </p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #f7f7f7;">Hawai</h3>
      <p>Coffee plantations are found all over the island of Hawaii, but they are best known for their Kona coffee on the Big Island of Hawaii and are always in high demand. Here, nature provides a suitable environment for the coffee trees on the slopes of the still active Maua Loa volcano. The young trees are planted in black volcanic soil, so it appears that farmers are often planting seedlings in stone. Afternoon shade from tropical clouds forms a natural canopy to protect the trees from the intense sun, and frequent showers provide the plants with an adequate amount of rain. Kona coffee is carefully processed to create a rich, aromatic medium-bodied cup.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #f7f7f7;">Panama</h3>
      <p>Panama is most distinguished for growing the Geisha coffee plant varietal (Coffea arabica var. geisha). Grown in Panama's Chiriqui Province, Geisha has won numerous coffee tasting awards in recent years, creating a high demand for the coffee at auctions.<br>
        Geisha coffee plants are known for their elongated coffee cherry (fruit), and the coffee is distinguished for its light body, bright acidity and jasmine-like aroma with honey and citrus tastes creating an outstanding cup character and profile.<br>
        Other coffee plant varietals grown in Panama include Typica (Coffea arabica var. typica), Bourbon (Coffea arabica var. bourbon), Catuai (Coffea arabica var. catuai), and Caturra (Coffea arabica var. caturra).</p>
