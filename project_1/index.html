    <h3 style="text-align:center;">HANDDRIP COFFEE</h3>
    <p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #f7f7f7;">COFFEE BEANS</h3>
      <p>A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10% and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee beans. Like Brazil nuts and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #f7f7f7;">COFFEE BELT</h3>
      <p>The coffee bean belt is where the worldâ€™s coffee is grown. The coffee belt lies between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, 23.5 degrees north and south of the equator. The coffee belt passes through some 70 countries, which have tropical climates that provide rich environments that are perfect for growing coffee. There are common biological necessities universal to all plants. The essentials for plant growth are sun, water, soil and air. These four combine to provide plants with the energy and nutrients that they need.</p>
