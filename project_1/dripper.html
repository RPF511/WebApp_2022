    <p>
        This dripper was first developed by Melita Benz. There is one extraction hole in the trapezoidal dripper. Our recipe suggests brewing at once without stopping during dripping after steaming. Since there is only one spout, it takes a long time to brew because the speed of the water is slower even if the incline is higher than that of the Kalita dripper. Since the maximum extraction speed is limited no matter how much water is poured, there is an opinion that it is a tool that burns less taste unless you prefer a slow extraction such as a drip method. So, in the end, Melitta's final tech is a drip dripper, and once you get used to it, you can create a deep and uniform taste, especially in terms of taste. It is rarely used in the workplace.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #f7f7f7;">Kalita</h3>
      <p>It is a Japanese product that was born when Melita spread to Japan. Unlike Melita, it has three holes. There is a theory that three holes were drilled for no reason because Melita patented a structure with one hole, and there is a theory that the hole was increased to alleviate Melita's unique tendency to overextract.

        It is more difficult to drip than Melita. As there are three holes, there are more variables than Melita. Since there are 3 outlets, a vortex is generated inside during extraction. Coffee doesn't come down from the three holes, but only two, or, in particular, from the middle and either side. This means that the coffee is not evenly brewed, but only partially brewed. As the trend of the coffee industry changes to emphasis on acidity and uniformity of extraction results, Kalita Dripper, which has a weakness in this area, tends to be less popular among young coffee lovers. In Korea, first-generation and middle-aged people still use it, but it is increasingly being replaced by Hario, Clever, and Kalita Wave at the bottom, regardless of hobby or industry.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #f7f7f7;">Kalita Wave</h3>
      <p>It is a newly created original dripper to escape from the influence of Melita and solve the many shortcomings of the Kalita Classic, and it is completely different from the classic. The conical funnel has a flat bottom and many horizontal folds inside, and the exclusive filter has a unique shape with vertical serpentine folds folded. 3 outlets.

        The characteristic of this dripper is that even beginners can easily get great results. The Kalita dripper was greatly influenced by the barista's water flow control, but in the case of the wave, it is designed so that the result can be maintained at a relatively constant level by minimizing the water flowing down to the dripper wall through the pleats of the filter.
        
        It is also a very popular dripper in the specialty industry along with Clever and Hario.</p>

      <p>It is a cone-shaped dripper with a spiral guide up to the tip of the dripper, so the water drains very quickly. Because the water drains quickly, the tannins that cause the bad taste of coffee are extracted to a minimum, and the taste is very soft. As it tends to be under-extracted compared to other drippers due to its characteristics, it is unlikely that even the bad taste of old beans will be extracted. Therefore, it is a dripper highly recommended for those who want a smooth, non-toxic coffee, and it shows its strength in the so-called clean cup.
